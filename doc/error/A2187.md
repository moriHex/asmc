## ASMC Nonfatal Error A2187

#### must use floating point initializer

A variable declared with the REAL4, REAL8, and REAL10 directives must be initialized with a floating-point number or a question mark (?).

This error can be caused by giving an initializer in integer form (such as 18) instead of in floating-point form (18.0).

_* ML 6.0 compatible error_
