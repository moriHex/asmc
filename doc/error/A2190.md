## ASMC Nonfatal Error A2190

#### INVOKE requires prototype for procedure

The INVOKE directive must be preceded by a PROTO statement for the procedure being called. When using INVOKE with an address rather than an explicit procedure name, you must precede the address with a pointer to the prototype.

_* ML 6.0 compatible error_
