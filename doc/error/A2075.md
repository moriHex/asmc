## ASMC Nonfatal Error A2075

#### jump destination too far [: by 'n' bytes]

The destination specified with a jump instruction was too far from the instruction. One of the following may be a solution:

- Enable the LJMP option.
- Remove the SHORT operator. If SHORT has forced a jump that is too far, n is the number of bytes out of range.
- Rearrange code so that the jump is no longer out of range.
