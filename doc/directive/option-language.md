**OPTION LANGUAGE**:_langType_

Specifies the default language type (C[CALL], PASCAL, FORTRAN, BASIC, SYSCALL, STDCALL, FASTCALL, VECTORCALL, or WATCALL) to be used with PROC, EXTERN, and PUBLIC. This use of the OPTION directive overrides the .MODEL directive but is normally used when .MODEL is not given.
