Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

## OPTION DLLIMPORT

This option makes the assembler assume that all PROTOs that follow this directive represent functions located in a dll. Syntax:

**OPTION DLLIMPORT**:&lt;dll_name&gt; | NONE

&lt;dll_name&gt; must be enclosed in angle brackets. Argument NONE will switch back to the default mode.
