Asmc Macro Assembler Reference

## OPTION EPILOGUE

**OPTION EPILOGUE**:[FLAGS|NONE|EPILOGUEDEF|_macroname_]

OPTION EPILOGUE:macroname

Instructs the assembler to call the _macroname_ to generate a user-defined epilogue instead of the standard epilogue code when a RET instruction is encountered.

OPTION EPILOGUE:EPILOGUEDEF

Revert to the standard epilogue code.

OPTION EPILOGUE:None

Completely suppress epilogue generation.

In this case, no user-defined macro is called, and the assembler does not generate a default code sequence. This state remains in effect until the next OPTION EPILOGUE is encountered.
