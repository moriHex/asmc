## operator MASK

**MASK {_recordfieldname_ | _record_}**

Returns a bit mask in which the bits in _recordfieldname_ or _record_ are set and all other bits are cleared.

_Note: **MASK** is disable by default in Asmc. Use [MASKOF](operator-maskof.md) or [switch -Zne](../command/option-zne.md) to enable Masm compatible opeators._
