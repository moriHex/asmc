;; Module Name:
;;
;;     unbufcp2.c
;;
;; Abstract:
;;
;;     Intended to demonstrate how to complete I/O in a different thread
;;     asynchronously than the I/O was started from.  This is useful for
;;     people who want a more powerful mechanism of asynchronous completion
;;     callbacks than Win32 provides (i.e. VMS developers who are used to ASTs).
;;
;;     Two threads are used. The first thread posts overlapped reads from the
;;     source file. These reads complete to an I/O completion port the second
;;     thread is waiting on. The second thread sees the I/O completion and
;;     posts an overlapped write to the destination file. The write completes
;;     to another I/O completion port that the first thread is waiting on.
;;     The first thread sees the I/O completion and posts another overlapped
;;     read.
;;
;;     Thread 1                                        Thread 2
;;        |                                               |
;;        |                                               |
;;     kick off a few                           -->GetQueuedCompletionStatus(ReadPort)
